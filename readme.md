This Project makes a one page website for promoting recorded album.  It includes a music player , and links to the major music outlets such as apple music and Spotify.

This project seeks to automate the process of adding track name , artwork and music , to the webpage.

This project uses webscraping tools to get the information such as track name, artist name, album artwork from the internet and then inject them in to a web page with minimal input from the developer.

This program only scrapes data from bandcamp.  The album must be on bancamp for this program to work.

The input is the url to the bandcamp album.

The webpage will also has links to the various major music sources.  Those links will have to be set manually in a configuration file.
